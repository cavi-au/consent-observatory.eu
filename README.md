# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Env Variables
create a `.env` file in the root of the project or set them using the host environment.
- `JOBS_ROOT_DIR` where should pending, running and finished jobs be stored?
